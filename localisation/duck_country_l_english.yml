 duc_idea_1:0 "California Missions"
 duc_idea_1_desc:0 "Beginning in 1769, Franciscan Monks began constructing a series of religious outposts in California. Originally built as a way of solidifying the Spanish claims to the land against encroaching Russian fur traders, they began evangelizing to the local native populations and were the earliest foundations for future Californian citiess"
 duc_idea_2:0 "El Camino Real"
 duc_idea_2_desc:0 "Connecting the Californian outposts, El Camino Real is a 600 mile road running the length of our nation. It allows quick movement of our people, and brings our long stretch of territory a little bit closer together."
 duc_idea_3:0 "Presidios"
 duc_idea_3_desc:0 "The military counterpart to the California Mission, the Presidios were built to establish control over the long stretch of territory we hold in Western America. Not only do they allow us to project our power but it also serves to protect our colonists from hostiles, whether native or foreign."
 duc_idea_4:0 "Bear Republic"
 duc_idea_4_desc:0 "For too long have far-away Kings and Governors held us back from making California into a true and modern state! Take up the Bear Flag and let us dictate our own future!"
 duc_idea_5:0 "Eureka!"
 duc_idea_5_desc:0 "While working at a lumber mill in the Northern parts of our territory, a foreman has discovered a shiny piece of metal in the tailrace: gold! Merchants, settlers, and capitalists are now working tirelessly to not only find the precious metal for themselves, but also to make a profit off of the miners in the process."
 duc_idea_6:0 "The Move Westward"
 duc_idea_6_desc:0 "Word has reached the ears of people far and wide of the discovery of gold in our mountains, and now settlers are traveling from across the globe to try and find riches for themselves. A population boom will surely follow; the gold rush is here!"
 duc_idea_7:0 "Natural Harbors"
 duc_idea_7_desc:0 "With the discovery of San Francisco Bay and other natural harbors along our coastline, the path to California and access to our natural resources has become all the easier. Merchants can now easily access our nation from the sea and we can now begin selling our goods to a much farther reaching market."
